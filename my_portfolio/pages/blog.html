Whether its Dreamweaver, Illustrator or Photoshop I enjoy all of them. I am currently in my sophomore year and were working on creating websites with the program Dreamweaver, its actually how I created the site you're reading now and I have to say it has been one of my favorites since I started my graphic design journey. </p>
